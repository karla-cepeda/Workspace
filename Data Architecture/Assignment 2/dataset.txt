Summary of what types of data they contain and what queries/analyses you plan on performing on that data:
- For the stock price from PayPal, i decided to perform a moving average computation from the 20, 50 and 200 days, as this information is used to figure out when to buy and sell stocks on open price.
- Another query to be done is the percantage change on open price.
- From the volume variable, I want to create a query to get the day with the highest number of assets traded in one day, week, and month and year.
